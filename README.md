## Quick Start

The best way to make a reliable mount using these files is to print the stressed parts out of PC. I use Prusament PC Blend.
The parts that are less exposed to user actions may be printed in PETG. I use Prusament PETG but also PETG+ from Microcenter.

Once all parts are printed, you need to worry about assembling them together.
